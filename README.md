  Hey I'm Franz Taborlupa!
</h1>

I'm a Data Scientist with an interest on web full stack development along with UX design towards data-driven software products with social impact.

I also pursue the arts particularly philosophy, media, photography and theatre in my free time and I advocate for Education, Environment, and Mental Health!

It may seem like a stark juxtaposition but I believe that humanities within technology is increasingly becoming essential as an effort to humanise technology.

In my spare time I play video games and read books (I love adventure and music games the most like Pokemon and NSR)! I also like watching videos about dinosaurs!
