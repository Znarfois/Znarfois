  Hey I'm Franz Taborlupa!

I'm a 19 year old budding software engineer that's learning about web and mobile full stack development along with UX design and Data Science towards data-driven software products with impact.

I also pursue the arts particularly philosophy, media, photography and theatre in my free time. I also advocate for Education, Environment, Mental Health, and the Youth!

It may seem like a stark juxtaposition but I believe that humanities within technology is increasingly becoming essential as an effort to humanise tech.
