  Hey I'm Franz Taborlupa!
</h1>

I'm a passionate learner pursuing Data Science with an interest on web and mobile full stack development along with UX design towards data-driven software products with social impact.

I also pursue the arts particularly philosophy, media, photography and theatre in my free time and I advocate for Education, Environment, Mental Health, and the Youth!

It may seem like a stark juxtaposition but I believe that humanities within technology is increasingly becoming essential as an effort to humanise technology.

In my spare time I play video games, I love adventure and music games the most! Pok√©mon Ruby has a special place in my heart.
